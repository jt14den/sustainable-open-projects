## What is Governance?

Governance defines how decisions are made in your project. It can include:

- Roles and responsibilities
- Decision-making processes
- Policies and codes of conduct

## Common Governance Models

- **Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)**: One or more founders retain final say over decisions.
- **Consensus-Based**: All major decisions are made collaboratively, often using voting or discussion.
- **Meritocratic**: Influence is earned through contributions and participation.
- **Foundation-Based**: A nonprofit organization provides oversight and long-term support.

## Governance in Context

There is no universal model—each project should adapt based on its goals, size, and community. Use ITAV’s "Governance Objectives" as a guide for what decisions your team should consider early.

## Exercise: Governance Alignment Worksheet

:::challenge

**Time: 10 minutes**

Use the ITAV Governance Worksheet (Appendix A) to assess your current or planned governance structure. Score the importance of aspects like leadership clarity, decision transparency, and community input.

In pairs or small groups, compare your scores and discuss:

- Which governance model seems best suited to your context?
- What trade-offs would your team be willing to make?
