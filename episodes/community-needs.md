## Who is Your Community?

Open projects often have multiple communities:

- **Contributors** who build or document the project
- **Institutional partners** offering resources or credibility

Identifying these groups early supports targeted outreach, governance, and technical design.

## Stakeholder Types

Stakeholders may include:
- Academic institutions
- Funders
- Developers and maintainers
- Advocacy groups
- Underrepresented or marginalized users

## Methods to Understand Needs
- Community surveys
- User interviews
- Feedback channels (GitHub issues, mailing lists)
- Co-design or participatory design workshops
