:::questions
- How do technical choices affect the sustainability of an open project?
- What are the trade-offs between simplicity, scalability, and maintainability?
- How can we align infrastructure decisions with community needs?
:::

:::objectives
- Identify infrastructure components critical to open project sustainability.
- Evaluate tools and platforms based on longevity, support, and community alignment.
- Use a scenario-based activity to choose infrastructure for a sample project.

## What Is Infrastructure in Open Projects?

Infrastructure includes all the technical tools and services that support your project:
- Code repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
- Communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Discourse)
- Data storage and hosting
- Documentation systems
- Project management tools

## Factors to Consider

- **Simplicity**: Can your team and contributors easily use and maintain it?
- **Scalability**: Will it still work as your project grows?
- **Interoperability**: Does it integrate well with tools your community already uses?
- **Support and Longevity**: Is the tool actively maintained and widely adopted?
- **Cost**: Are there hidden costs in the long term?

## Tool Selection Framework

Use the ITAV framework’s technology facet to guide evaluation:
- Prioritize based on current phase (Getting Started, Growing, Stable)
- Score options on community adoption, ease of onboarding, sustainability, and flexibility

:::challenge
**Exercise: Infrastructure Scenario Planning**  
**Time: 15 minutes**

You are launching an open educational resource platform. In groups:
- Identify 3 infrastructure needs (e.g., code hosting, user contributions, discussion forum)
- Choose from a set of provided tools (or your own suggestions)
- Justify your choices based on criteria above

Share back with the group.

:::discussion
What infrastructure decisions have had a lasting impact (positive or negative) on a project you’ve worked on? What would you do differently now?
:::

:::keypoints
- Infrastructure decisions are strategic—not just technical.
- Tools must match your project’s phase, team capacity, and community expectations.
- Re-evaluating infrastructure over time is essential to long-term sustainability.
