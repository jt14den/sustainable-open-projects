:::questions
- How do technical choices affect the sustainability of an open project?
- What are the trade-offs between simplicity, scalability, and maintainability?
- How can we align infrastructure decisions with community needs?
:::

:::objectives
- Identify infrastructure components that support open project sustainability.
- Evaluate tools and platforms for long-term support and community fit.
- Practice selecting infrastructure through a scenario activity.

## What Is Infrastructure in Open Projects?

Infrastructure refers to the technical tools and services that support your project:
- Code repositories (like GitHub or GitLab)
- Communication platforms (like Slack or Discourse)
- Data storage and hosting
- Documentation systems
- Project management tools

## Factors to Consider

- **Simplicity**: Is it easy for your team and contributors to use and maintain?
- **Scalability**: Will it keep working as your project grows?
- **Interoperability**: Does it connect well with tools your community already uses?
- **Support and Longevity**: Is it actively maintained and broadly used?
- **Cost**: Are there long-term or hidden costs?

## Tool Selection Framework

Use the technology facet of the ITAV framework to guide decisions:
- Match tools to your current phase (Getting Started, Growing, or Stable)
- Score tools on adoption, ease of use, long-term viability, and flexibility

:::challenge
**Exercise: Infrastructure Scenario Planning**  
**Time: 15 minutes**

You're launching a platform for open educational resources. In small groups:
- Identify three infrastructure needs (such as code hosting, contributions, or discussion)
- Choose tools from a provided list or suggest your own
- Explain your selections using the criteria above

Report back to the full group.
:::

:::discussion
Think about a project you've worked on. Which infrastructure choices stuck with the project—for better or worse? What would you change today?
:::

:::keypoints
- Infrastructure choices shape a project’s future. They’re strategic decisions.
- Tools should fit your project’s stage, team skills, and community needs.
- Revisit your setup regularly to keep it sustainable.
